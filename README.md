# Predicting Bitcoin Price Direction with Random Forest Machine Learning Model

This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting the next-day direction of Bitcoin's price (up or down) using historical market data and engineered technical indicators. The project leverages financial features, statistical techniques, and a Random Forest classifier to build a predictive model.

The notebook walks through the full process:  
- Data collection using `yfinance`  
- Feature engineering with technical indicators  
- Feature selection  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Visualizations of predictions and performance metrics
